TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Below are common issues that occur when attempting to install and
configure Vadmin.


* When attempting to initiate certain actions, this error appears:

    SYSTEM ERROR: Failed to create /var/lib/vadmin/example.org.db!. We
    apologize for the inconvenience, but your request cannot be completed
    at this time. Please contact your system administrator if the problem
    persists.

  Inspect your web server logs for any error that may have occurred
  when this message appeared on screen.  You may need to increase
  you PHP error logging level by adjusting php.ini and restarting your
  web server.  See also: 
  http://squirrelmail.org/docs/admin/admin-12.html#errormessages
  Any errors found herein should help you determine the source of
  the problem and should be included in any help requests you make.

  Verify that the web server has write permissions on /var/lib/vadmin
  (or whatever location you set "[storage]->dir" to in conf/vadmin.conf.
  There are example commands for how to do so in the INSTALL document
  in the CONFIGURATION section.  When testing whether or not this is 
  the cause of the issue, you may give read, write and execute 
  permission to everybody (chmod 777), but you MUST do this only 
  temporarily - just long enough to test.  When asking for help about
  this kind of problem, you should be prepared to show the ownership
  and permissions of this directory.

  The other cause of this problem can be that your PHP build does not 
  include support for the database flavor that you have configured
  in "[storage]->flavor" in conf/vadmin.conf.  Please check your PHP
  dba support (using phpinfo() is one good way; see: 
  http://www.php.net/manual/function.phpinfo.php or see:
  http://squirrelmail.org/wiki/TestPHPSettings) and verify that you 
  have configured the db flavor correctly.  Also, please refer to
  the REQUIREMENTS section of the Vadmin INSTALL document, as well as
  http://php.net/manual/ref.dba.php


* When attempting to initiate certain actions, this error appears:

    SYSTEM ERROR: Could not open /var/lib/vadmin/example.org.db for 
    writing. We apologize for the inconvenience, but your request cannot 
    be completed at this time. Please contact your system administrator 
    if the problem persists.

  Please refer to the tips immediately above.


* When some configuration settings are changed, they do not seem to
  take effect.

  This may happen either when testing your configuration with 
  SquirrelMail's src/configtest.php or when using the Vadmin interface 
  itself.

  Vadmin caches its configuration settings for better performance.  If
  you make any configuration changes, you must log out and back in again
  to see them take effect.  When using the SquirrelMail configuration 
  test utility (src/configtest.php), this may mean you need to close the
  browser before re-running the configuration test to see your changes
  take effect.

  Advanced usage: you can open the config_parser.php file and change
  the return value of the use_cached_vadmin_vars() function to FALSE,
  which will make Vadmin reload all configuration settings for every
  page request.  This should only be used for debugging and testing and
  should be changed again when you put your system into regular usage.


* When changing a user password to something insecure, an "Override"
  button appears, but it does not do anything.

  This will happen when the password contains illegal characters, and
  this condition can never be overridden because such a password could
  corrupt the system.  If the "Override" button does not work for any
  other kind of password problem, then this is a bug that needs to be
  reported to the developers.
