3.0
   * Ensure compatibility with SquirrelMail 1.5.2+ (no guarantees
     about versions 1.5.0 and 1.5.1)
   * Added flexible backend functionality; implemented SQL backend
     - Several functionality changes, tweaks and adjustments accompany 
       the addition of flexible backends - keep your eye out!
   * Removed functionality from setup.php
   * Remove use of require_once
   * Removed needless includes after validate.php

1.9.3
   * Small bugfix:
     - Discard anything in control/virtualdomains that starts with a "#"

1.9.2
   * Small bugfixes:
     - Don't try to delete a dba key that doesn't exist
     - Lowercase all usernames
     - domain passed via the url takes precedence over the cookie
	
1.9.1
   * Initial domains now looked up based on the username of the person
     logging in. This will break for people who use a real (non-vmailmgr)
     address as their elvis address.
   * Builtin rc4 provided for those who don't want to rebuild php.
   * Redirecting from an insecure domain to a secure location 
     implemented (useful for domains with only one https certificate).

1.9.0
   * Killed all 1.0 changelogs.
   * MASSIVE code changes and cleanups.
   * Works with Squirrelmail-1.4 (well, and ONLY in squirrelmail-1.4)
   * Killed the scripts, largely replacing the functionality
     within vadmin itself and/or letting people edit things manually.
   * Now utilizing dba routines for file storage.
   * Domain limits fully implemented.
   * Autoresponder support fully implemented (requires 
     qmail-autoresponder)
   * Cleanly upgrades v1 save files, so little migration is needed
     apart from what is outlined in doc/UPGRADING
   * Full i18n support (at least as far as vadmin goes. Not sure on 
     l10n support for things like usernames and such). See
     doc/TRANSLATING
   * Domain templates fully implemented.
