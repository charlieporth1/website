Translating Vadmin
------------------

Translating Vadmin is simple and easy.  Before translating Vadmin, 
see translating.txt in the SquirrelMail doc directory, which will 
help you understand how the SquirrelMail translation system works.

To translate Vadmin, you will need to edit the file named
vadmin.pot.  If this file is missing from the main Vadmin directory, 
please download the plugin again.

Edit the vadmin.pot file with your favorite text editor and
fill in the msgstr lines according to the msgid strings.  Also,
you will need to put your name and email address in the header 
at the top of the file, and make sure not to forget to change
the other settings at the top, especially the CHARSET parameter.

If you have questions about which values to change, Google can 
be very helpful, as can the squirrelmail internationalization
mailing list.

Now you need to place the translated .pot file in the SquirrelMail
locale directory for your language.  If you don't already know it,
you can find the code for your locale here:

http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html

Using the Turkish (tr_TR) locale as an example (assuming you are
currently located in the vadmin plugin directory):

  $ mv vadmin.pot ../../locale/tr_TR/LC_MESSAGES/vadmin.po

Note that you have now renamed the file as a .po file.

The last step is to compile your translation.  Change to your locale
directory and use the following command:

  $ cd ../../locale/tr_TR/LC_MESSAGES
  $ msgfmt -o check_quota.mo check_quota.po

Your translation is now complete.  Switch to your locale from the 
Display Preferences in SquirrelMail and test your translations.  If 
your translations do not appear to be working, try restarting Apache, 
because sometimes strings are cached.

The community would be grateful if you would then send your translation
to the SquirrelMail internationalization mailing list for inclusion in
the SquirrelMail locales package:

  squirrelmail-i18n@lists.sourceforge.net

Thanks for your help.
